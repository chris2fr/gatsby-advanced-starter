TaskWhy is a simple software idea, but I found that Workflowy.com did basicly the same thing, so I let it go.

A Task.How is a an indefinate verb phrase (in the form "do something" such as "buy milk") that you provide. The software provides context by associating other Task.Hows for you in a to-do structure (in the form "to achieve something do take some intermediate step" such as "to go grocery shopping do buy milk"). These to-do Task.Hows then may be infinately encapsulated ("to achieve something to take some intermediate step do take one detailed step and do take another detailed step" such as "to run errands to go shopping at the supermarket do buy milk and do buy coffee"). Simple.
