The goal is to provide a shared space that be **comfortable, accessible and secure**. After considering different alternatives, we settled on Zoom simply because it seems to work. Other reasonable alternatives are WebEx, Google Meet and Jitsi. Criteria for choice are availability, robustness, security, accessibility, ubiquity, etc. We can change if convenient, and I am actually interested in Jitsi (for similar reasons I am interested in Telegram over WhatsApp and GNU Mailman over Mailchimp).

The Zoom Pro account is open to all at one unique address @ the below link. The link already incorporates the meeting ID and password.

How We Use Our Shared Zoom Room
-------------------------------

No need for a user account, but _**we do now verify people as they join**_ scheduled meetings to avoid spammers. Previously registered and associated accounts can bypass the lobby salon. The waiting room is generally deactivated and the room open outside of scheduled meetings. Scheduled meetings also have standing breakout rooms for flexibility and security.

Most meetings have a _**telephone option** **to complement the video**_ through the internet, and as a back-up solution for audio-only participation. When you join, you can choose to use telephone audio instead of the audio through the internet in order to have a more stable voice connexion. This can be important, because we have a much better experience with smooth audio even if the video is choppy. Telephone-audio only is a backup last-resort solution and information on that is further down.

If possible _**please do activate your video**_ right away. As a matter of courtesy, the host or so-host will try to acknowledge you soon after you enter. Having your video on will allow you to physically raise your hand for example. You are welcome in the meeting.

We sometimes have background noise. Be mindful if your microphone is muted or unmuted. _**Please unmute when it is your turn to talk**_ and mute otherwise. The host or co-hosts also have the option of muting you, so don't be surprised. There are times when we do all talk together, so unmute then as well.

**_There is no recording of audio nor video_** by anyone. Settings are such that the option is not available to hosts nor to any participants. No participant my bypass this technical block by other means. The public text chats and text chats to the host are recorded, so be mindful about what you type.

You, the host and co-hosts have the **_possibility of renaming_** you. Do give yourself an understandable name or don't be surprised if a Host does so for you. Sometimes we have generic names that are hard to identify (such as "Galaxy A4" that are better understood when "Hovik" for example).

You have a **_host of tools_** available to you in the conference including chats, participant lists, grid view (my preferred, and necessary for a host) or speaker view, "hide-self" by right-clicking on your own video feed to not be distracted by looking at you (a relief for me), shared screen (remember check box to activate computer sound if you will share video) and even remote control of a computer (if consent given).

We have the possibility of **_"breakout rooms."_** These rooms allow for mini-sub meetings between participants. Attendance can be randomly assigned or manually assigned by the host (no co-hosts, sorry). I sometimes use a breakout room to provide assistance to individual members.

Otherwise, please respect **_protocols of digital decorum_**. Please limit talking only to one person, instead of the whole group.

If you are new to Zoom, don't worry, it is accessible. Instructions are below. **_Text me if there are any issues_** (+33781811811).

A Word About Administration
---------------------------

Whilst this room is usually kept open without a waiting room or lobby, I will put in place a waiting room when I run an event as a second-level of security. I also intend to keep a permanent breakout room "help" so that I as host may help individual participants or have a side video discussion if need be.

I have spent considerable time and thought tweaking the settings. Should you wish to do the same, I am happy to help.
