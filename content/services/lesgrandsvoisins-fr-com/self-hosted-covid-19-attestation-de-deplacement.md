Mahdi Mokhtari put in place (I still have to document) a server for the attestation dérogatoire de déplacement here:  
[https://covid19.lesgrandsvoisins.fr](https://covid19.lesgrandsvoisins.fr)

This is an opensource solution. It allows us to guarantee that the information is not held on any server. We only use it to create your attestation and then we forget it.

Documentation available here/
