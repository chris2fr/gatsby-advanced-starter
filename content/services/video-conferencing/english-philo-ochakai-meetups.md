We share right now is a Pro ZOOM account (140 € per year).  This fundraiser will also serve to reimburse MEETUP costs for the English Phlio Cafe and Ochakai (about 240 €).  
Beneficiaries of these services are :  
\* Users of the above-mentioned meetup groups  
\* Ad-Hoc users from other groups who use the shared resources  
\* I also would like to help with digital inclusion

Beyond this first fundraiser, we may seek to mutualize other resources such as web hosting, telephone subscriptions and other things.
