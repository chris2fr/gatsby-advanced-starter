We are able to set up our own open-source video server. For the time being, we are only hosting it on [Les Grands Voisins](https://www.mann.fr/en/realizations/lesgrandsvoisins-fr-com/self-hosted-video-conferencing/), but in the near future, I will have an alias for [vchat.mann.fr](https://vchat.mann.fr).

It is of open-source Jitsi Meet technology. This allows mann.fr to certify that it is secure and respectful.
