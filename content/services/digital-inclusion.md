The internet is a new opportunity to exclude marginalized populations. Our efforts here are to invite digitally marginalized populations to be able to participate in the virtual society. This is done by setting up computer rooms and giving computer classes to otherwise internet-challenged students.

I put in place three-way partnerships between:

*   Social Workers,
*   Beneficiaries (Students), and
*   Volunteers

to set up computer rooms in emergency-housing or similar facilities and animate workshops.

I also would appreciate donations of computers by businesses and non-profits for our effort.

I also animate a group a solo-entrepreneurs in a self-support group.

Digital Inclusion with Aurore, the ACP and others
-------------------------------------------------

This is about:

*   coordinating with social workers to set up computer rooms and run computer workshops in temporary housing centers or similar spaces;
*   soliciting computer equipment from large companies for redistribution to those on the wrong side of the digital divide.

Work addressing the _digital divide_ started in 2015 and continues with the public-utility Aurore (social services in Paris, housing tens of thousands of marginalized persons) by setting up and maintaining _computer rooms_ and setting up and running _weekly workshops_ in _foyers_ d'h√©bergement d'urgence, in _centres_ d'accueil du jour and in _salles_ polyvalentes for _marginalized persons_, for _teaching volunteers_ and for _social workers_.
