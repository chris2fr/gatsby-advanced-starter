[LesGrandsVoisins.fr/.com](https://www.lesgrandsvoisins.fr/.com) is a project extension in a virtual world of Les Grands Voisins insomuch as it:

*   is a space (digital websites [lesgrandsvoisins.fr/.com](https://lesgrandsvoisins.fr/.com) and [lesgrandsvoisins.com/.fr](https://lesgrandsvoisins.com/.fr)) and an identity (a trademark deposited the same day as another holder, rendering it defacto public domain)
*   provides events ; infrastructure (or at least a network) for non-profits, artists, artisans, social enterprises and ; social purpose through concrete action.
*   is a governance structure.

One participant describes it as a place where professionals do things together.

For now, we are meeting every two weeks in the [sharted Zoom account](/en/video-conferencing/).

Here is the HackPad with our configuration information:
