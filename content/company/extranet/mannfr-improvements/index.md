[Home](https://www.mann.fr/en/home/)
------------------------------------

There is a page where we can put content, but it ins't used. The Home Page is not managed with the content management system.

[Common Elements](https://www.mann.fr/en/wp-admin/widgets.php)
--------------------------------------------------------------

The common elements are defined in the Widgets.

### Header

#### [Top Navigation Menu](https://www.mann.fr/en/wp-admin/nav-menus.php)

Limited to two levels. I guess OK, perhaps bring Chris Mann to a higher level.

#### Left and right linear navigation

#### Search feature

#### Language switcher

Are the two flags, one grey and one colored, ergonomic enough? #question

For some reason, I can't update the widget witht he below code.

[![EN/FR](https://www.mann.fr/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/united_states_of_america_32.png?resize=32%2C24&ssl=1)](https://www.mann.fr/fr/)

[![EN/FR](https://www.mann.fr/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/united_states_of_america_32.png?resize=32%2C24&ssl=1)](https://www.mann.fr/fr/)  

### [Sidebar](https://www.mann.fr/en/wp-admin/widgets.php)

This has in-category navigation.

### [Footer](https://www.mann.fr/en/wp-admin/widgets.php)

This has contact info. The left-right linear navigation can be removed.

### Comments

Comments are currently deactivated. Comments could be activated such that we better identify what needs to change on each page.

[You](https://www.mann.fr/en/you/)
----------------------------------

This page has the comics for the six target marketing populations and an old text below it basically offering the same option of navigating to the six target-populations.

#todo tell better stories in each of the submenus.

### [Entrepreneur / Pro](https://www.mann.fr/en/you/professionals-freelancers/)

### [Individual / Employee](https://www.mann.fr/en/you/individual/)

### [Business](https://www.mann.fr/en/you/business-team/)

### [IT Pro](https://www.mann.fr/en/you/it-professional/)

### [Nonprofit Organization](https://www.mann.fr/en/you/nonprofit-team/)

### [Marginalized](https://www.mann.fr/en/you/marginalized-person/)

[Solutions](https://www.mann.fr/en/solutions/)
----------------------------------------------

Four panels on to to show the four categories of services I offer.

### [D. IT Engineer](https://www.mann.fr/en/?page_id=2691)

This is a service category I am less confident in. Therefor it is deactivated. I don't think I am an engineer, neither in title nor in temperment.

#### [System Administration](https://www.mann.fr/en/solutions/it-services/sysadmin/)

#### [Software Development](https://www.mann.fr/en/solutions/it-services/programming/)

#### [Configuration Management](https://www.mann.fr/en/solutions/it-services/configmanage/)

### [D. Digital Organizer](https://www.mann.fr/en/?page_id=736)

This is a deactivated service page. Many of the services here have to do with meaningless maintenance. I am not sure I am good at it.

#### [Webmastering](https://www.mann.fr/en/solutions/digital/webmastering/)

#### [Collaborative Environments](https://www.mann.fr/en/solutions/digital/digital-collaborative-environments/)

### [Consultant](https://www.mann.fr/en/solutions/business/)

This is about Business-IT consulting. Business-IT might actually be my profession. As a consultant, I like tech scouting. I like trying things.

My approach is to put in place routines, regular meetings, that can be there when needed.

#### [Time Accounting](https://www.mann.fr/en/solutions/business/capacity-planning-for-empowerment/)

This is really about capacity planning. I love capacity planning.

#### [Cross-Cultural Collaborations](https://www.mann.fr/en/solutions/business/cross-cultural-connections/)

This is about localizing French products in the US, or likewise. Perhaps it is also about off-shore dev work.

#### [Program & Project Management Office](https://www.mann.fr/en/solutions/business/program-project-management-office/)

This is about succeeding in doing unexpected things expectedly!

### [D. Social Psychology Consultant](https://www.mann.fr/en/?page_id=2911)

I like working with organizational considerations and would like to find partners with whom I can work, mainly a social psychologist. I don't know what legitimacy I would have for this right now.

#### [Psycho-Social Risk Management](https://www.mann.fr/en/solutions/wellbeing/psycho-social-risk-management/)

#### [Guided Meditation](https://www.mann.fr/en/wp-admin/post.php?post=3214)

#### [Product R&D](https://www.mann.fr/en/solutions/digital-projects/product-rd/)

### [Coach](https://www.mann.fr/en/solutions/team-coach/)

I worked with a group around Lego-for-Scrum that worked well. I also like to help teams manage backlogs. I can be demanding, but that is what is expected from a coach.

#### [IT Development Team Coach](https://www.mann.fr/en/solutions/team-coach/development-team-coaching/)

#### [Team-Building Workshops](https://www.mann.fr/en/solutions/team-coach/team-building/)

------------------------------------

I think there should be side menus here. Also the photos are taking up too much space.

[Hire](https://www.mann.fr/en/contact/)
---------------------------------------

The contact form doesn't send mail. #TODO #UGLY

The absence of a side menu is strange, understandable, but strange.
