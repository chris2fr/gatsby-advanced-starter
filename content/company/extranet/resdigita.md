ResDigita is pseudo-latin for "the digital thing." The goal here is to intelligently share electronic resources.  
Currently, we need to finance a pro Zoom account and two Meetup groups (English-Speaking Caf√© Philo and Ochaika) for use of a digital room mentioned in the web page "[Video Conferencing Here for Everyone](https://www.mann.fr/en/projects/video-conferencing/)."

_Please contribute here_ in order to keep the ResDigita resources open:

Many resources require a single login and password. Our response to that is to use the shared gmail account "resdigita@gmail.com" and a password (or passwords) the organizers of Zoom share.
