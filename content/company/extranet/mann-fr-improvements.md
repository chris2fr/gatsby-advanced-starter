Consider the Place of the Blog
------------------------------

There is a lot of content. Perhaps some of it can be put into blog articles. Also consider aligning the categories of the website with the blog.  
Update 2020-04-28: I think the blog on the home page was the way to go.

### Comic Sales Pitch

The idea is to set up a situation or situations in a comic fashion on the front page. First Panel: Someone totally overwhelmed by a situation. Second Panel: demonstrating the real problems of that situation, the horrible effects that could happen (maybe thought bubbles of the impending death and doom). Third Panel: Person on the floor, saying "oh, mann!". Fourth panel: MANN.FR flying in to save the day.

Michael Muszlak initially though about his friend Christian who had trouble with using his own personal computer, but such circumstances could be in the areas of:

*   Projects at a stand-still
*   Psycho-social risk
*   Misunderstandings between IT and Business
*   etc.
