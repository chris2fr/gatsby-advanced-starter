Information technology services are about computers, web, programming & networks. Make IT work by:

*   [Configuration Management](/en/configmanage)
*   [Programming](/en/programming)
*   [System Administration](/en/sysadmin)

I, Chris Mann, have taken proficiency tests in Javascript, Ruby, Python and PHP to great success.

I have extended experience with configuration management. ConfigMagic.com is a project specifically for this.

I have extended experience working with large production evironments (Alsthom, BNP Paribas).
