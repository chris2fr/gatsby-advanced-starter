Be You in English Too
---------------------

All too often the French think there is one way to express themselves in English when in fact there are multiple ways. The goal is to find your way of expressing yourself with what ultimately is a handicap of the English language for you.

I look at the way you express yourself in French and try to find ways for you to be you in English. Language transmits identity. This is a learning journey, not just about language, but about who we are.

I have helped friends with significant oral presentations in the past: Aggregation, CAPES and significant others. What I do is I observe you as you present and then I reconstitute what I had understood. This way, you are better able to see what messages you get across and adjust accordingly.
