I was able to help friends prepare their CAPES and AGREGATION oral presentations with success, I was able to help a Director of a multi-national non-profit present in English at an international conference in Japan with success. My talent is listening to your presentation and feed back to you what I hear such that you better your way of expressing yourself.

This works very well for English identity seeking. When French speakers express themselves in English, they sometimes forget that language is also a tool for conveying identity. For them, English speaking is a handicap. I help francophones apprehend their handicap in this sense.

This works well also for cross-cultural collaborations. In seeking to work with teams from other countries, it is important to understand how others may apprehend you requests or work fulfillment.
