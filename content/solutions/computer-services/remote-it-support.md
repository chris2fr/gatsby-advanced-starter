1\. Call Me
-----------

Here is my phone number:  
+33 781 811 811

2\. Initiate Chat
-----------------

There is a little blue chat icon on the bottom right. Click it and we can exchange text information instantly. This will be useful, notably to copy and paste.

3\. Share Screen
----------------

Sharing a desktop allows me to see what you see on your screen. It also can allow me to control your mouse and keyboard in order to show you things. I do this with personal respect for your computer and your information.

### Google Remote Desktop

Google Remote Desktop seems to show robustness.

Click on the down-pointing arrow next to “Get Support” and follow the directions. Support in this context means that I am providing assistance to you.

### Zoom Conferencing with Screen Share and Remote Control

It is possible to meet in my Zoom Room. When in the conference, choose “share screen” and then I will request remote control. You click “authorize” or something to that effect. Here is my personal Zoom conference room:

### Windows Quick Assist

These solutions assume that I am sing my Windows 10 PC. We can use the internal tools built into Window for remote assistance.

#### If you use Windows 10

In Windows 10, from a Windows 10 computer, one may use “Quick Assist.” Here are instructions for that:

#### If you use a Windows Earlier than Windows 10

In Windows prior to Windows 10, the utility to use, from a Windows host providing assistance, is Windows Remote Assistance. Indications on this subject are below.

Here is how you may determine which Windows you have.
